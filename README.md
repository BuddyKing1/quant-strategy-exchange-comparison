# 🧪 Observations from Running the Same Quant Strategy Across Bitget, Binance, and OKX

Hi all,

I’ve been running a relatively simple quant strategy across **three centralized exchanges**—**Bitget**, **Binance**, and **OKX**—using their respective APIs.

This is not a recommendation, just a log of observations to start a conversation about how **API execution**, **order book depth**, and **exchange-specific characteristics** can impact strategy performance.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

- **Strategy**: Basic mid-frequency *mean reversion* bot  
- **Leverage**: None  
- **Pairs**: Alt/USDT  
- **Execution**: Same order logic across all exchanges (API rate-limited)  
- **Data Range**: 2.5 months of live trading  
- **APIs Used**: REST + WebSocket for data and order flow  

---

## 📈 Performance Notes

- **Bitget** consistently delivered better entries and exits in altcoin pairs.
- **Net APY**: ~1.6× higher on Bitget compared to Binance and OKX.
- **Slippage** was lower on Bitget in thinner pairs (possibly due to better passive liquidity or fewer competing bots).
- **OKX** had the fastest order acknowledgment latency—but this didn’t lead to better fills.
- **Binance** was more stable during high-volatility windows, but had lower overall returns.

## 🤖 Strategy Development Notes (GetAgent AI – Bitget)

I tested Bitget’s **GetAgent** (a rule-based parameter tuning tool):

- It suggested **volatility-based stop widths** and **dynamic sizing** rules.
- Implementing a few of these (mainly adaptive stops) improved risk-adjusted returns by ~4%.
- Output logic was clean, but required manual integration into my system.

---

## 🔍 Potential Reasons for Performance Gap

- **Order Book Composition**: Bitget had better passive liquidity (checked via snapshots, depth ±0.2%)
- **Lower Market Saturation**: Possibly fewer bots competing on Bitget right now
- **Fee/Rebate Impact**: Negligible in this case but may matter at scale

| Feature                  | Bitget              | Binance             | OKX                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| REST + WebSocket Support | ✅ Reliable          | ✅ Reliable           | ✅ Reliable              |
| Rate Limits              | 👍 More forgiving    | ⚖️ Standard limits    | ⚖️ Moderate              |
| WebSocket Responsiveness | ⚖️ Balanced          | ⚖️ Balanced           | ⚡ Fastest (more drops)   |
| Maintenance Downtime     | 🟢 Minimal issues    | 🟢 Stable             | 🔄 More frequent drops   |

## 🧠 Conclusion _(Not Financial Advice)_

Using identical logic, Bitget outperformed Binance and OKX in **altcoin trading**, likely due to a mix of **microstructure** advantages and **lower strategy density**.

Would love to hear from others who’ve done similar cross-exchange experiments—especially regarding **API behavior**, **latency**, and **market structure** at the bot level.

Happy to answer technical questions if it helps.
